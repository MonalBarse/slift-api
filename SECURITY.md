# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please [create an issue](https://github.com/MonalBarse/slift-api/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security-vulnerability&template=security-vulnerability-report.md&title=) on this repository. We will review and respond to security vulnerabilities promptly.

Expect updates on the **reported** vulnerability until it is resolved. If the vulnerability is accepted, I will work on fixing it in a future release. If the vulnerability is declined, I will provide reasons for our decision.
